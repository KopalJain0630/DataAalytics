43,325,"The eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups, termed the middle class, who earned their wealth through an expanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such as woollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the richer members of society. In addition to merchants and manufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers or administrative officials. All of these were educated and believed that no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a person s social position must depend on his merit. These ideas envisaging a society based on freedom and equal laws and opportunities for all, were put forward by philosophers such as John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In his Two Treatises of Government, Locke sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute right of the monarch. Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a form of government based on a social contract between people and their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu proposed a division of power within the government between the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model of government was put into force in the USA, after the thirteen colonies declared their independence from Britain. The American constitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important example for political thinkers in France.",eighteenth century witnessed emergence social group termed middle class earned wealth expanding overseas trade manufacture good woollen silk textile exported bought richer member society addition merchant manufacturer estate included profession lawyer administrative official educated believed group society privileged birth person social position depend his merit idea envisaging society based freedom equal law opportunity forward philosopher john locke jean jacques rousseau his treatise government locke sought refute doctrine divine absolute monarch rousseau carried idea forward proposing form government based social contract people representative spirit law montesquieu proposed division power government legislative executive judiciary model government force usa thirteen colony declared independence britain american constitution guarantee individual right political thinker france

It is true that analysis of the organ structure in fossils allows us to make estimates of how far back evolutionary relationships go. But those are guesses about what happened in history. Are there any current examples of such a process? The wild cabbage plant is a good example. Humans have, over more than two thousand years, cultivated wild cabbage as a food plant, and generated different vegetables from it by selection (see Fig. .). This is, of course, artificial selection rather than natural selection. So some farmers have wanted to select for very short distances between leaves, and have bred the cabbage we eat. Some have wanted to select for arrested flower development, and have bred broccoli, or for sterile flowers, and have made the cauliflower. Some have selected for swollen parts, and come up with kohlrabi. Some have simply looked for slightly larger leaves, and come up with a leafy vegetable called kale. Would we have thought that all these structures are descended from the same ancestor if we had not done it ourselves?",dissimilarlooking structure evolve common ancestral design true analysis organ structure fossil estimate evolutionary relationship guess happened history current example process wild cabbage plant good human year cultivated wild cabbage food plant generated vegetable selection fig artificial selection natural selection farmer wanted select short distance leaf bred cabbage eat wanted select arrested flower development bred broccoli sterile flower cauliflower selected swollen part kohlrabi simply looked larger leaf leafy vegetable called kale thought structure descended ancestor

By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part of that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A society based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration of the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.

The story is about Bimala, the wife of Nikhilesh, a liberal landlord who believes that he can save his country by patiently bettering the lives of its poor and marginal sections. But Bimala is attracted to Sandip, her husband s friend and a firebrand extremist. Sandip is so completely dedicated to throwing out the British that he does not mind if the poor low castes suffer and Muslims are made to feel like outsiders. By becoming a part of Sandip s group, Bimala gets a sense of self-worth and self-esteem. Rabindranth also shows the contradictory effects of nationalist involvement for women. Bimala may be admired by the young males of the group but she cannot influence their decisions. Indeed she is used by Sandip to acquire funds for the movement.

In the first half of th century they tried to collect maximum land revenue through deshmukhs and it resulted in desertion of lands by peasants and complete decline of agriculture. In view of this situation, the Nizam s government set up a new land revenue arrangement by which the government appointed district officials to collect land revenue directly. The old landlords were compensated with an annual payment called rusum and they were also given patta rights of full ownership over the land and adjoining waste lands and forests. As the landlords realized that there was a large export market for several agricultural products like castor groundnut etc. they brought more waste lands under cultivation to grow these crops. But who will work on those lands? They expanded the scope of vetti or unpaid labour by forcing ordinary peasants and village artisan and service castes to work on landlord s lands. The large landlords were called Doras . The Doras lived in large fortified houses called gadi and had a large retinue of servants and soldiers. They had vast lands cultivated by tenants and also lands directly cultivated with forced labour. They acted as village moneylenders too. They also had judicial powers over the entire village. They settled all village disputes and were usually partisan towards the upper castes. Other village officials like patwaris and smaller landlords too had to abide by their orders. They forcibly ensured that the lower caste labourers worked for all the upper castes and especially the landlords. They enforced such rules like no lower caste person could wear shirts or slippers or wear a turban, and always remain bent before the doras and address them as their masters.",nizams ruled hyderabad state british follow policy half century collect maximum land revenue deshmukhs desertion land peasant complete decline agriculture view situation nizam government set land revenue arrangement government appointed district official collect land revenue directly landlord compensated annual payment called rusum patta right ownership land adjoining waste land forest landlord realized large export market agricultural product castor groundnut brought waste land cultivation grow crop work land expanded scope vetti unpaid labour forcing ordinary peasant village artisan service caste work landlord land large landlord called doras doras lived large fortified house called gadi large retinue servant soldier vast land cultivated tenant land directly cultivated forced labour acted village moneylender judicial power entire village settled village dispute partisan upper caste village official patwaris smaller landlord abide order forcibly ensured lower caste labourer worked upper caste landlord enforced rule lower caste person wear shirt slipper wear turban remain bent doras address master

At the same time Muslim scholars developed a holy law called Shariat. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice.",islam propagated strict monotheism submission god rejected idol worship considerably simplified ritual worship collective prayer time muslim scholar developed holy law called shariat sufi rejected elaborate ritual code behaviour demanded muslim religious scholar sought union god lover seek his beloved disregard saintpoets sufi composed poem expressing feeling rich literature prose including anecdote fable developed great sufi central asia ghazzali rumi sadi nathpanthis siddhas yogi sufi believed heart trained developed elaborate method training zikr chanting sacred formula contemplation sama singing raqs dancing discussion parable breath control guidance master pir emerged silsilas genealogy sufi teacher method tariqa instruction ritual practice
